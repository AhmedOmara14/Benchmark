# Microbenchmark Module

This module contains **Microbenchmarks** for measuring the performance of small, isolated parts of the project, such as:
- Business logic (`domain/usecase`)
- Data models (`domain/model`)
- Repository operations (`data/repository`)
- JSON serialization/deserialization (`data/remote`)

Microbenchmarks help ensure that your domain and data layers remain efficient as the project grows.
